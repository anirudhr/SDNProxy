SDN-based HTTP Connect Proxy with Content Filtering

Initial environment:
* Edge switch drops all HTTP traffic (base rule)
* Applications/users configure proxy as CONTROLLER

Controller flow:
   Receives HTTP traffic -> Polices -> Forwards -> Communicate
                          /    |   \                  |
                         / Denies   \            Install flow
                        /   (403)    \
      Prune aged unused rules        * Blacklisted domains (read using ConfigParser) get denied.
      (Future?)                        - Blacklisting can be on a per-user /
                                         per-group basis too
                                     * Future: filter responses based on
                                       content: block multimedia, suspect files, etc.
